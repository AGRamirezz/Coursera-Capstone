# Coursera-Capstone
This project culminates learned objectives from the first IBM DS specialization, which taught all foundational skills in general data science approaches. The project itself is focused on the problem exploration aspect of DS approaches. The background of this proposed context is similar to when a small-medium sized business employs tech business consultants to a brand new business solution i.e., a from scratch business problem.
