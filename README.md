# Coursera-Capstone
This project culminates learned objectives from the first IBM DS specialization, which taught all foundational skills in general data science approaches. The project itself is focused on the problem exploration aspect of DS approaches. The background of this proposed context is similar to when a small-medium sized business employs tech business consultants to a brand new business solution i.e., a from scratch business problem. The 'Final' folder contains all files submitted for the final assignment in the course. In sum, this project exemplifies an initial 'estimate' presented to our hypothetical consultees. This helps them take a high level question into a defined problem space with several insights that gives the business several choices. Those of which have a path for further consultation employment as well as enough insights to take into independent business solutions from the presented exploration.
